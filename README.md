## Using this template

After cloning this repo, run ``npm install`` in the project's root to install the project dependencies. Then run ``npm start`` to build the project. This will open the project on a local server (default is 8090). After that any changes to the ``./src`` file will reload the project. 

``npm build`` will build your code into a bundle located at ``dist``.
